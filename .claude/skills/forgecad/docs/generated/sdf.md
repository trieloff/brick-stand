# SDF Modeling

Signed Distance Field modeling for organic forms, smooth booleans, TPMS lattices, and deformations. SDFs are inherently implicit fields, not B-rep/exact geometry; use them with caution when precision or exact export matters. Return raw `SdfShape` values directly for native preview; use `toShape(...)` when materializing SDF trees for CAD/export workflows.

## Functions

### SDF Materialization

#### `toShape()` — Materialize one SDF leaf or all SDF leaves in a renderable tree.

Raw `SdfShape` values become mesh-backed [`Shape`](/docs/core#shape)s. Plain objects and arrays preserve their renderable children as a [`ShapeGroup`](/docs/core#shapegroup) when more than one leaf is found. Non-renderable metadata is ignored for materialization and remains available to callers through normal [`require()`](/docs/core#require) return values.

```ts
toShape(value: unknown, options?: SdfToShapeOptions): ToShapeTreeResult
```

**`SdfToShapeOptions`**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `edgeLength?` | `number` | Target mesh edge length. Smaller = finer mesh. Overrides quality-derived resolution. |
| `bounds?` | `{ min: Vec3; max: Vec3; }` | Override auto-computed bounds. Strongly recommended for infinite/repeated fields. |
| `quality?` | `SdfMeshingQuality` | Coarse quality preset. Default: 'preview'. |
| `tolerance?` | `number` | Preferred absolute surface tolerance in millimeters. |
| `minFeatureSize?` | `number` | Smallest feature that should survive meshing, in millimeters. |
| `simplify?` | `boolean \| "safe"` | Simplification control. `false` disables, `true` and `'safe'` use topology-validated simplification. |
| `maxTriangles?` | `number` | Optional post-extraction triangle budget. |
| `maxGridPoints?` | `number` | Optional pre-extraction grid-point budget. Default is browser-safe. |
| `minEdgeLength?` | `number` | Lower clamp for resolved edge length. Default: 0.15mm. |
| `diagnostics?` | `boolean` | Log resolved meshing settings and backend extraction timings. |

#### `combine()` — Collapse a tree of SDF leaves into one continuous SDF field.

This intentionally discards per-leaf color/material identity because the result is one scalar field. Use plain object returns for multi-material SDF preview, and use `combine(...)` only when you want one implicit body.

```ts
combine(value: unknown, options?: CombineOptions): SdfShape
```

`CombineOptions`: `{ op?: "union" | "intersection" }`

## Classes

### `SdfShape`

An immutable SDF expression. Supports SDF-specific operations (smooth booleans, domain warps, etc.), can be returned directly for native preview, and converts to a ForgeCAD Shape via `.toShape()` when materialization is needed.

#### `colorHex()` — Display color carried by this implicit leaf.

```ts
get colorHex(): string | undefined
```

subtract(...others: SdfShape[]): SdfShape
```

```

#### `smoothIntersect()` — Smooth intersection — smoothly intersects.

```ts
smoothIntersect(other: SdfShape, radius: number): SdfShape
```

#### `morph()` — Morph between this shape and another. t=0 → this, t=1 → other.

```ts
morph(other: SdfShape, t: number): SdfShape
```

#### `translate()` — Translate this SDF by the given offsets in millimeters.

```ts
translate(x: number, y: number, z: number): SdfShape
```

```

#### `shell()` — Hollow out, keeping only a shell of given thickness.

```ts
shell(thickness: number): SdfShape
```

#### `displace()` — Displace the surface by a function of position, or by a pattern SdfShape.

```js
// Function displacement
shape.displace((x, y, z) => Math.sin(x) * 0.5)

// Pattern displacement (e.g. basketWeave)
shape.displace(sdf.basketWeave({ threads: 16, spacing: 3 }))
```

```ts
displace(fn: ((x: number, y: number, z: number) => number) | SdfShape, constants?: Record<string, number>): SdfShape
```

#### `surfaceDisplace()` — Displace the surface using a 2D pattern in surface-local UV coordinates.

Automatically detects the shape's UV parametrization (sphere, cylinder, torus) from the SDF tree. Falls back to triplanar mapping for arbitrary shapes.

UV coordinates are in **surface millimeters** — patterns defined with `spacing: 3` always produce 3mm spacing, regardless of shape size.

```js
// Surface-following basket weave — auto-detects sphere UV
sdf.sphere(27).shell(3)
  .surfaceDisplace(sdf.basketWeave({ spacing: 3, depth: 0.8 }))
  .toShape()

// Custom 2D pattern via function
shape.surfaceDisplace((u, v) => -Math.sin(u * 2) * 0.3)
```

```ts
surfaceDisplace(pattern: SurfacePattern | ((u: number, v: number) => number), options?: SurfaceDisplaceOptions): SdfShape
```

#### `onion()` — Create concentric onion layers.

```ts
onion(layers: number, thickness: number): SdfShape
```

## Constants

### `sdf`

SDF modeling — signed distance field primitives, smooth booleans, TPMS lattices, domain warps, and surface patterns.

Return `SdfShape` values directly from a ForgeCAD script for native raymarch preview. Plain objects and arrays of SDF leaves are renderable too, so object keys become named preview parts.

Call `.toShape()` or `toShape(...)` only when you need a mesh-backed ForgeCAD Shape for export, mesh booleans, or mixed SDF/manifold projects. All shapes live as a lazy expression tree until that materialization boundary.

SDF is inherently implicit and sampled, not B-rep/exact geometry. Use it with caution when precision, tolerances, or exact export matter.

```js
return sdf.smoothUnion(sdf.sphere(10), sdf.box(15, 15, 15), { radius: 3 })
  .color('#4488cc');
```

```js
return {
  shell: sdf.sphere(20).shell(2).color('#9be7ff'),
  core: sdf.gyroid({ cellSize: 6, wallThickness: 0.8 })
    .intersect(sdf.sphere(18))
    .color('#ffcf5a'),
